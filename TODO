todo:
* user interface for constructing lambda cell structure
  var, abst, appl, copy, destroy
* abstract view of Lexp?

* Lequiv: check alpha-convertibleness
* var num canonicalization (also good for regression test)

* define interface (cf. testz.c) -> hide initialization
* reinitialize


Hmm, cannot get benefit from GC_malloc if I have my own pool...
